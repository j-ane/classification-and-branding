# Customer Loyalty Classification and Branding Strategy
Customer loyalty was categorized by the number of times they visited the restaurant. Respondents were considered low-loyalty customers if they visited 1-3 times,
medium-loyalty customers if they visited 3-5 times, and high-loyalty customers if they visited more than 5 times. The decision alternatives for this objective is 
to determine whether or not a low- or medium-loyalty customer would convert into a high-loyalty customer, and whether or not a high-loyalty customer would remain 
at the same loyalty level. 
In order to study the restaurant’s positioning strategy, the survey included a 5-point likert scale questions to study the customers’ perception of various factors. 
The decision alternatives are to determine which of the qualities customers felt more favorable for and select the optimal qualities to position the restaurant on.

When it comes to classifying customers, the best option is to use LDA to estimate loyalty levels. The high-loyalty customers are well-separated from the other 
two segments, which explains why all three models perfectly predicted the high-loyalty customers in the test data. 

The LDA model indicates that high-loyalty customers return for their experience at the restaurant and its convenience in terms of price and service. 
They care less about marketing in terms of ads and gift incentives, as they are already loyal and do not need to be exposed to it as much. If they would like 
to retain more high-loyalty customers, the restaurant should start by first improving the food quality that was ranked surprisingly low among high-loyalty customers.

As we estimated earlier, it appears that medium-loyalty customers are likely to be truck drivers who are not in the area often but do stop by when they 
pass through the highway on the job. Since they appreciate parking availability, gift incentives, and location, it would be nice to draw in additional truck drivers 
by expanding on the gift incentive option with additional advertisements and possibly a referral program since truck drivers tend to have a tight-knit community 
with each other over radios. 

As for low-loyalty customers, they appear to respond well to advertisements but rarely find a reason to return. They seem to react positively towards servicescape, 
but nothing else. Perhaps the restaurant could look into a possible disconnect between the physical design of the restaurant and the actual restaurant experience.
